# GettingAndCleaningData
A repository for a Coursera course.

This is an assignment for a Coursera course on getting and cleaning data. Presented with a series of data sets that are separate and poorly labeled
I am tasked to compile all of the data, rename variables, and turn the data into Tidy format.

In this repository, the R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
